# Billboard 100 and Spotify ETL

## About the Project

Hello everybody! 

Welcome to another ETL project. Music was a big part of my life in my 20's and early 30's so I wanted to do a project on it. This came up when I did a linear regression on Spotify's API and got audio features. Since then it lookes like a few of their features are depricated and cant get that metadata. Oh well I decided to use what data I could get. Billboard has a library that gives me the top 100 songs for the week graded on their metrics. I decided to join these two data sets to track the age of a song vs its rank and vs its popularity. I was just curious and also it give me a reason to do another ETL project. I utilezed free public APIs, Pandas, and loaded everything into big query. Below you will see a preview of it. 

Stay tuned as you will see this orchestrated in Airflow in the future.
